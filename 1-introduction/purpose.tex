\section{Purpose}
Security vulnerabilities are growing in impact and volume and become an increasingly bigger risk for many people and organizations. More and more work is being put into detecting malicious activity, but little focus is put on detecting whether or not a system has not been exploited before a patch was installed.
\\
\\
The subject of this project will be researching theoretical and practical ways of detecting the exploitation of vulnerabilities by using the knowledge gained from investigating patches. To do this, the project will analyze a vulnerability and the associated patch to explore how built in tracing and logging features of Windows can be used to detect exploitation attempts of the vulnerability. The results of this effort will be analyzed and used to explore if and how this technique could be extended to dynamically detect exploitation of other vulnerabilities given a patch.
