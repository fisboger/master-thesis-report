\paragraph{Chapter 2: Tracing and logging.} In this chapter we present the theory behind tracing, logging and telemetry methods and tools within the Windows operating system.

\paragraph{Chapter 3: Vulnerability analysis.} In this chapter we present the analysis of CVE-2021-24086 that lead to the root-cause of the vulnerability and a fully working \gls{POC}. Furthermore, the chapter also contains a primer on IPv6 headers needed to exploit CVE-2021-24086.

\paragraph{Chapter 4: Detection.} In this chapter we analyze CVE-2021-24086 in regards to the detection methods discussed in \textbf{chapter 3: Vulnerability analysis}. As a part of this analysis we showcase an application that is able to detect exploitation attempts of CVE-2021-24086.

\paragraph{Chapter 5: Discussion.} In this chapter we discuss and compare the differences between the detection methods of \textbf{chapter 3: Vulnerability analysis}. We also discuss the work needed to create an automated and scalable solution that can use patch information to detect vulnerability exploitation attempts.

\paragraph{Chapter 6: Conclusion.} In this chapter we resent the general conclusion for the work done.
