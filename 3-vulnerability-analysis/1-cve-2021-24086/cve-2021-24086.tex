\subsection{Public information}
Due to the \gls{mapp}\cite{url:microsoft:mapp} security software providers are given early access to vulnerability information. This information often include \gls{poc}s for vulnerabilities to be patched, in order to aid security software providers to create valid detections for exploitation of soon-to-be patched vulnerabilities. Due to \gls{mapp}, some security software providers publish relevant information regarding recently patched vulnerabilities. However, the information is usually very vague in details, and can therefore only aid in the initial exploration of the vulnerability. For CVE-2021-24086, both McAfee\cite{url:mcafee:cve-2021-24086} and Palo Alto\cite{url:palo-alto:cve-2021-24086}
