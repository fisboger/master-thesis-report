\chapter{Scaling and automation}
\label{cha:scaling-and-automation}

% Explain section. What is the goal, relate this to the introduction (see description)
% Explain the two methods we used, their differences.
% Explain the information we gained from the patch
% Explain pros and cons for both, relate this to the information gained from patch

% Next up: Scaling
% Can we automatically extract patch information.
%   -> Kinda, but we are unable to parse it in a good way. Needs more research
% We see that ETW is probably not a good fit.
% Given that we are able to extract meaningful data from patch, can we use that data to automate hooking?

% Present future work
%   -> Analyze more patches to understand fixes
%   -> Implement an actual function to do automatic hooking based on patch information
